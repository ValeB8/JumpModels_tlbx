To train and valudate a MJM:
- run solveMJLS.m (see ConvergenceTest.m for reference)
- validate the model with valMJLS.m (see ConvergenceTest.m for reference)

To reproduce the examples reported in Section 4.2 run:
- ConvergenceTest.m
- MonteCarloSimulation.m
- NTest.m
- OnlineTest.m
- SNRTest.m
--> Identify a Markov Jump linear System
- EnergyConumption.m ---> Learn and validate the models for the electric consumption of 4 appliances

Look at OnlineTest.m as a reference to use the method for online learning
